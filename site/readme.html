    <h1>Considerations</h1>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
        I've decide to update only the table row's. The table's header, as is something that will not change, is written directly in the index.html page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data received from the stomp server is updated on a global internal structure (dataStruct), but we only update the DOM with the affected rows. <br>
        This also applies when sorting the data by the <i>lastchangeBid</i> attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've created a table.js file where all the needed logic has been assembled. The idea was to build a component to refresh the table when data from the stomp server, arrives.<br>
        The table compoment has an init method, where we could initialize the table. For this challenge, only the selector "#data" is passed as parameter, so we can create a global var pointing to that table structure.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most important public method is the <strong>update</strong> from the table.js file. This method is called every time a new message arrives.
        <h3>How it works?</h3>
        <p>
            1- A new message arrives<br>
            2- The internal dataStruct object is updated. This is a map where the Key will be the currency ID. <br>
            3- The mid price is calculated. Here we take into account the last 30 seconds, so a new structure (midprice) with an array of [timestamp,midprice] is needed. We only consider the last 30seconds. Olders are removed. <br>
            4- Update the row. If the entry does not exist, here we create a new one. Otherwise, the data is updated and only this ROW is repainted.
            5- Eventually, we need to sort the data. The last update could change the order, so we sort the dataStruct and once ordered, we apply the changes to the DOM.
        </p>
    </p>

    <h1>Testing</h1>

    <p>
       I've added Mocha to make unit testing. To execute, only run "npm test". <br>
        The folder "test" consist of two files:
         <ul>
        <li><strong>mockData.js</strong>: Sample data to run the tests</li>
        <li><strong>test.js</strong>: There are two tests. One to calculate the mid price, and another to sort all the data in the global internal structure.</li>
</ul>

    </p>
